Practical Tasks (pick your stack)
Task 1 — Build a Production-Ready CRUD + Auth API
Choose one (your call):
Option A (JavaScript/TypeScript): Node.js + Express or Fastify + PostgreSQL (Prisma/TypeORM)


Option B (Python): FastAPI + PostgreSQL (SQLAlchemy)


Option C (Go): net/http or Gin + PostgreSQL (sqlc/GORM)


Feature: orders service
Endpoints:


POST /auth/register, POST /auth/login (hashed passwords; lockout after 5 failed attempts/15 min)


POST /orders (validate payload, idempotency key in header)


GET /orders?limit&cursor (cursor pagination)


GET /orders/:id


PATCH /orders/:id (partial update; reject unknown fields)


Data model (min):


users(id, email UNIQUE, password_hash, created_at)


orders(id UUID, user_id FK, total_cents INT, currency CHAR(3), status ENUM[pending,paid,cancelled], created_at)


Requirements:


Input validation (schema-based)


DB migrations


Indexes on orders(user_id, created_at DESC) and orders(status)


E2E tests for happy-path + auth failures + pagination


Error model with trace id


Basic rate limiting (per-IP + per-user)


Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml for local run


Acceptance checks:


Creating duplicate POST /orders with same Idempotency-Key does not double-insert


GET /orders returns stable pagination under concurrent inserts


Unauthorized requests get 401 with structured error


Load test (~100 RPS for 60s) keeps p95 < 200ms on local


Scoring (100 pts):
Correctness 35, Reliability (idempotency, pagination) 25, Security 15, Tests 15, DX/Docs 10.


Task 2 — Diagnose, Optimize & Make It Safe
You receive a struggling service:
Symptoms: p95 = 1.4s, occasional 500s, DB CPU 95%, cache hit rate 5%.


Code smells discovered:


ORM N+1 on GET /orders?include=items


No indexes on orders(status) or order_items(order_id)


In-process cache with global map (no TTL), causes stampede and memory spikes


Unbounded goroutines/workers or async tasks without backpressure


Secrets in .env committed to repo


Webhook endpoint accepts POST from anywhere, no signature check


Deliverables:
A written diagnostic report (≤500 words) prioritizing issues by impact.


Code diffs or pseudocode that:


Add proper JOIN + eager loading/select_related to kill N+1


Create indexes and verify improvement (explain before/after EXPLAIN plans)


Introduce Redis with TTL + request coalescing (single-flight) to prevent stampedes


Implement bounded concurrency/backpressure


Add HMAC signature verification for webhooks


Rotate secrets and add secret scanning in CI


A runbook: how to roll out safely (migrations, canary, metrics to watch: DB CPU, hit rate, p95).


Acceptance checks:
p95 < 300ms after fixes under the same load profile


DB CPU < 60% sustained; cache hit rate > 60%


Webhook requests without valid signature are rejected with 401/403 and audited


CI blocks PRs with committed secrets
