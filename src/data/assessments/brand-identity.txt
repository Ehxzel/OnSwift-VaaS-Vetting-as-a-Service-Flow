Hands-On Vetting Tasks (2 Practical Tests)
Task 1: Redesign Brief


A fintech startup called “VaultPay” wants a modern, trustworthy logo that appeals to Gen Z but also reassures older audiences. Create 1–2 logo concepts and provide a short rationale (max 100 words).


Task 2: Critical Evaluation


Review this hypothetical logo: a tourism brand uses a palm tree with 5 gradient colors. Write a short critique (max 200 words) covering its effectiveness, cultural adaptability, and where it might fail.
2. Real-Life Tasks (hands-on vetting)
Task 1: Redesign exercise


Brief: “A small coffee brand named Bean & Bloom wants a clean, modern logo that works for packaging and social media. Create 1 logo concept (no more than 2 colors) and provide a 2-sentence rationale.”


Task 2: Brand audit exercise


Brief: “Review this sample logo [we’d supply an average/mediocre one]. Write a short critique (max 200 words) covering strengths, weaknesses, and how you’d improve it.”
